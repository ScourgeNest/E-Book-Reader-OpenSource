#  Components and Estimated Power Consumption

Now that we have detailed the components of the project, we can approximate the energy consumption based on typical values for each component.

## üîã Components and Estimated Power Consumption

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Polymer Lithium-Ion Battery (CELLEVIA BATTERIES LP584174)**
   - **üîã Voltage:** 3.7V  
   - **‚ö° Capacity:** 1800mAh  
   - **‚è≥ Battery Life:** Depends on total consumption, but with a capacity of 1800mAh, the battery could power the device for several hours.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **ESP32 C6 (Main Processor)**
   - The ESP32 C6 has variable power consumption depending on usage:
     - üí§ **Idle mode:** ~0.1mA  
     - üì° **Wi-Fi active:** ~200mA  
     - üîµ **Bluetooth active:** ~150mA  
     - üöÄ **Max (under heavy load, e.g., during communication):** ~350mA  

   - **‚ö° Assumed average consumption:** **150mA**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **üìú 7.5‚Äù E-Paper Display**
   - **Typical consumption:** 30-50mA during screen updates (very low power when idle).
   - Assuming updates happen a few times per hour, an average consumption of **40mA** can be expected.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **üõ∞Ô∏è Environmental Sensor BME688**
   - **Typical consumption:** 2-3mA during measurement.
   - We estimate **2mA** for the BME688 sensor.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **‚è∞ RTC Module DS3231SN**
   - **Typical consumption:** 1-2mA
   - Assuming an active mode, we estimate **2mA**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **üîÑ Li-Po Battery Charging Controller (MCP73831T)**
   - **Power consumption:** Minimal during charging, so it is **negligible** for this estimate.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **üíæ SD Card**
   - **Typical consumption:** 10-15mA during data access.
   - We estimate **12mA** for the SD card.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **üî• External NOR Flash (64MB)**
   - **Typical consumption:** 20-30mA when reading data, lower in standby mode.
   - We estimate **25mA** for active usage.

---

## üìä Total Power Consumption Estimation (Typical Configuration)

Assuming the ESP32 is continuously active with Wi-Fi, the e-paper display updates every 10 seconds, and the BME688 sensor is continuously measuring.

| ‚öôÔ∏è Component                        | ‚ö° Consumption (mA) |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| üì° **ESP32 C6 (Wi-Fi active)**       | 200mA              |
| üìú **E-Paper Display (Updating)**    | 40mA               |
| üõ∞Ô∏è **BME688 Sensor (measuring)**    | 2mA                |
| ‚è∞ **RTC Module (active)**           | 2mA                |
| üíæ **SD Card (in use)**              | 12mA               |
| üî• **External NOR Flash**            | 25mA               |

### ‚úÖ **Total Consumption (Typical Use):**
‚ö° **200mA** (ESP32) + **40mA** (Display) + **2mA** (BME688) + **2mA** (RTC) + **12mA** (SD Card) + **25mA** (NOR Flash) = **281mA**

---

## ‚è≥ **Estimating Battery Life**

Given that the battery has a capacity of **1800mAh**, and assuming a typical consumption of **281mA**, we can estimate the battery life:

üìè **Battery Life Calculation:**  
`Battery Life = Battery Capacity / Average Consumption`  
`Battery Life = 1800mAh / 281mA ‚âà 6.41 hours`

## üì¢ **Conclusion**

Under continuous usage (**Wi-Fi active, periodic e-paper updates, and sensor readings**), the estimated battery life is **~6.4 hours**. However, real-world performance may vary due to:

- üîã **Power-saving optimizations** (e.g., deep sleep mode on ESP32)  
- üîÑ **Lower update frequency for e-paper display**  
- üì° **Disabling Wi-Fi/Bluetooth when not needed**  

For **longer battery life**, optimizing power consumption by using sleep modes, reducing display updates, and minimizing SD card writes will be crucial. üöÄüîã

The first step was to place the components on the PCB and connect them according to the provided schematic. This step was crucial to ensure that all the components were correctly positioned and interconnected.  

## üìê Step 2: PCB Layout and Compatibility with Case  
Once the components were placed, the second step was to arrange them on the PCB layout to fit the given casing. I made sure that the connectors and pins aligned properly with the case's openings for ports and buttons.  

## üîå Step 3: Routing the Connections  
The third step involved routing the connections between the components (wires), where I encountered my first challenge. Due to suboptimal component placement, I had to route some power lines using vias, which were also routed on the bottom layer of the PCB. Additionally, I used a relatively large number of vias. However, as an engineer, I recognized that things don't need to be perfect, so I moved forward with the process, compensating with extra attention to detail in later steps.  

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 4: 3D Models for Each Component  
With the electrical schematic and PCB layout complete, the next step was to import and attach 3D models for each component. I sourced the models from various platforms, such as SnapMagic, Mouser, Comet, Component Search Engine, etc. These models helped visualize how the components would fit together in the final product.  

## üîã Step 5: Battery and Display 3D Design  
At this point, I used the datasheet for the **Polymer Lithium-Ion Battery (CELLEVIA BATTERIES LP584174)** to create its 3D model for the PCB. Similarly, I applied the same process for the **7.5-inch e-Paper V2 display**, ensuring both components were accurately represented in the 3D design.  

## üèóÔ∏è Step 6: Final Design Assembly  
With the 3D PCB design complete, along with all components in place, I moved on to assembling the full design of the **E-Book Reader**. This included the **PCB, battery, display, and casing**, resulting in the final product design.
